# Numerical Integration

This program calculates the integral of a function using both the trapezoidal rule and the rectangular rule. It first defines the the limits of the integral (i.e. the values a and b in the equation) and the number of slices / integral divisions. It then calculates the integrals of  𝑓(𝑥)=𝑥, 𝑓(𝑥)=𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑥, and 𝑓(𝑥)=𝑒<sup>−𝑥</sup>𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑥  between  𝑎=0  and  𝑏=1  using both rules. It then outputs the value of the approximation for  𝑛=2  (two slices) up to  𝑛=100 , and graphs the result at each stage, showing how the answer approaches the correct value.
